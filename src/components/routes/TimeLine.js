              <br/>I took very seriously my goal to be a developer and initiated studying 
              as a self-taught web developer and knew a lot of technologies in the web 
              development world as Django, Flask, Agular, Vue, React and also initiated
              getting to know the databases as SQL and MongoDB.

              <br/>QA analyst in Konrad Group: I Helped with system issues with a 
              web and mobile application. Checking it to see the releases were in a 
              good status to released them.
              <br/> I also had to replicate customer issues to find the problem they 
              were having in the application and forward the issue to the developers.
